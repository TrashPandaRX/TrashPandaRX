(method) event: (coro: Any) -> Any
A decorator that registers an event to listen to.

You can find more info about the events on the documentation below <discord-api-events>.

The events must be a coroutine <coroutine>, if not, TypeError is raised.

Example
. code-block:: python3

    @client.event async def on_ready():
        print('Ready!')
'''
