### Hi there this is my github!ðŸ‘‹

I don't update things normally, mostly because I forgot about this. But I realized I really ought to have some of my code out here as I'm looking for employment right now as an entry level Software engineer or entry ai engineer. I'm trying to get my masters degree right now, but if I get an opportunity for an internship or better yet a job I'll just make time to do both somehow!

Still looking for my little unity games that I did for class, they are one one of my hard drives somewhere...

PS: if you sift through my stuff please forgive the language I use. 99.9% of the time the comments are all directed at myself so that I have...strong, salient wording to remind myself to handle some things I've neglected or begging for a future version of myself to fix some mess I made.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... getting my masters degree in CS (focus in AI) from UNO.
And also looking for an entry level SE job so i can get on my feet

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... python, C# (unity focused atm), AI, java, and some prolog (will start learning SQL soon!)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... bots, modding games, debugging software, AI projects, pen testing, etc
(theres so many interesting things to learn and do in CS its amazing!)

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... learning how to freelance/finding a job in the industry, advice on python AI, game design, and data science

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... anything! I don't think I have anything to hide (aside from passwords and how many hours I sleep each night)

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... (efvalerius@gmail.com is my professional email, but efarve@me.com is the easiest to contact me. But i check both frequently)

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... he/him (but honestly idc what you call me, as long as you mean no disrespect)

- âš¡ Fun fact: ... My bachelors was in psychology because i was acutely afraid of mathematics despite having an strong curiosity in programming.
But I got over that fear and wholeheartedly embrace my old weakness,
even if some of the technically intensive calculations are still difficult, its enjoyable figuring it out now!

8/25/23 update:
Currently have experience in Python, C#, Ruby on Rails, JS/TS, React, Node.js, Java, C. My few months of professional experience were in fullstack software engineering using RoR + JS/TS + React + Node.js + PostgreSQL.
